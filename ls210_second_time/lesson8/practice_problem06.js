// Implement a function that takes some text as an argument and logs some information about
// whether the text has a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

// Here's an excerpt of some text taken from a Wikipedia article that compares different
// versions of "To be, or not to be".

// input - multi-line string
// output - multi-line string

// rules:
// - count the number of positive words and negative words, and log them to the console
// - log to the console the overall tone of the text depending if there are more positive or negative
//   words

// algorithm:
// - replace all non alphabetic characters with nothing
// - split input text into array by whitespace
// - use filter on the text to filter out anything that's not included in the array
//   - use #includes
// - use if conditional to determine overall sentiment
