# In an earlier practice problem we saw that depending on variables to be
# modified by called methods can be tricky:

def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga"
  an_array_param << "rutabaga"
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"

# We learned that whether the above "coincidentally" does what we think we
# wanted "depends" upon what is going on inside the method.
#
# How can we refactor this practice problem to make the result easier to
# predict and easier for the next programmer to maintain?
