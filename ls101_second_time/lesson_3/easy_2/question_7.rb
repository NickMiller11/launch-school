# In the previous practice problem we added Dino to our array like this:

flintstones = %w(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)
flintstones.concat(["Dino", "Hoppy"])

p flintstones

# We could have used either Array#concat or Array#push to add Dino to the family.
#
# How can we add multiple items to our array? (Dino and Hoppy)
