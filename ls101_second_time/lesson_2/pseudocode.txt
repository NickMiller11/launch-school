1) a method that returns the sum of two integers

2) a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string
that is all those strings concatenated together

3) a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array
with every other element


-------

1) given two integers, add integer 1 to integer 2

START

*Given two integers being passed into the method as arguments

Add integer 1 to integer 2

END

--------

2) given an array of strings
- initialize a variable and set to an empty string
- call method each on the array passed into the method
- concatenate each string onto the empty string
- return the string variable

START

*Give an array of strings being passed into the method as an argument

SET a variable as an empty string

Call the each method on the input array
  Concatenate each string from the array onto the empty string variable

RETURN the string variable

END

--------

3) a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array
with every other element

3) given an array of integers
create a new empty array and assign it to a variable
call the each with index method on the input array
push the integer into the new array if the index is odd
return the new array

START

*Given an array of integers being passed into the method as an argument

SET a variable as an empty array

Call the method each_with_index on the input array
  IF the index is odd
    Call the method push on each integer

RETURN the new array of integers

END
