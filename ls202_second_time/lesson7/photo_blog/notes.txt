Questions (watch video again afterwards)

- How do you measure the px value of text?  Do you measure uppercase? lowercase?
- Is there good rules of thumb for aligning things using padding/margins?


Things I noticed while redoing the instructur-led version:

- The camera logo is set as the background image of the header rather than
  added to the HTML document.

- Setting the a element to block means that the whole element will be clickable

- Used the header to represent the width of the page, not the body

- Uses padding to align items with respect to each other, not margins.  The only
  margins used were with respect to an image, using a bottom margin to separate it
  from the heading text.

- sets the width for header, footer and main separately to same width, then
  centered it all using margin: 0 auto;

- seems like the best way to measure the text size is to measure from the bottom
  of a character that hangs down (y or g) to the top of an uppercase character as
  font-size represents the whole spectrum
