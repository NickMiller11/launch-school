Questions from doing the exercise:
- what is the best way to handle the dots to each side of the headings?
- what is the best way to align the social media icons in the footer (without flex)?


Watching through solution video:

- they put the header logo in a <h1> tag (just for semantic purposes?)
  - if you do this, you can using something like text-align: center on the logo

- they are talking about styling things away from the next top element, this could
  be an interesting way of thinking about HTML and CSS.  For example, move the
  top logo away from the top of the page.  Move the main body away from the top logo, etc.

- if using a background image, also set a background color in case the image doesn't
  load if you wouldn't be able to view part of the page without the background image
  For example: body {
                background: #2f2840 url("bg_body.gif");
               }

- In order to arrange the social media icons in the footer, they used an inline display
  for the li elements and text-align: center in the ul.
  For example: ul {
                 margin: 0;
                 text-align: center;
               }
               li {
                 display: inline;
                 padding: 0 62px;
               }
